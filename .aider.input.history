+Code the following app
+```
+ROLE & GOAL
+You are an expert web game developer creating a simple, fast-loading browser mini game inspired by Flappy Bird, but with a fun crypto theme. The game will live as a mini app and should be easy to play in under 1 minute per round. Players can optionally win tiny sponsored token rewards based on their score, using a pre-funded prize pool that I manage outside the game.
+
+GAME CONCEPT
+
+Title: “The Flappy Coin”
+
+Core mechanic: Tap / click / spacebar to make a character “flap” and avoid obstacles. If they hit an obstacle or the ground, the run ends.
+
+Theme:
+
+Character: a cute pixel-style crypto coin or rocket (with eyes / personality).
+
+Obstacles: on-chain themed (e.g., “gas clouds,” “rug spikes,” “bear walls,” “regulation pipes”).
+
+Background: simple scrolling sky or blockchain-style grid so it runs smoothly on mobile and desktop.
+
+GAMEPLAY & SCORING
+
+Simple one-button control:
+
+Desktop: spacebar or click.
+
+Mobile: tap anywhere.
+
+Score = number of obstacles successfully passed.
+
+Show:
+
+Live score during the run.
+
+“Game Over” screen with: current score, best score (local), and how much token the player would earn for this run.
+
+Game speed should increase slightly as the score goes up to keep it challenging.
+
+REWARD LOGIC (TINY CRYPTO PRIZES)
+I will handle the actual token distribution off-chain or via a backend API. Your job is to:
+
+Implement pure front-end reward logic that calculates a “suggested reward” for a completed run using this model:
+
+Example reward tiers (configurable in one place in the code):
+
+Score 0–9 → $0 in tokens (no reward)
+
+Score 10–24 → $0.01 worth of tokens
+
+Score 25–49 → $0.03 worth of tokens
+
+Score 50+ → $0.10 worth of tokens (max per run)
+
+Output the reward in two ways on Game Over:
+
+In USD equivalent (e.g., “Estimated reward: $0.03 in tokens”).
+
+In token units, using a placeholder token symbol (e.g., $GAME):
+
+Let me easily update: TOKEN_SYMBOL, TOKEN_DECIMALS, and TOKEN_USD_PRICE in a config object.
+
+The front-end must not hold private keys or send transactions by itself. Instead, after the game:
+
+Show a CTA button such as “Claim via Sponsor” that triggers a function call like onClaimReward(score, estimatedReward) that I can later wire up to my backend or wallet flow.
+
+SPONSORED PRIZE POOL CONSTRAINTS
+Design with the assumption that:
+
+I maintain a finite sponsored prize pool of tokens.
+
+Rewards are tiny and mostly for fun: micro-amounts like $0.01–$0.10.
+
+You should:
+
+Include a comment in the code where I can plug in a backend API (e.g., GET /rewards/estimate and POST /rewards/claim).
+
+Include a visible disclaimer in small text:
+
+“Rewards are promotional, limited, and not guaranteed. Payouts are subject to sponsor availability and may change or end at any time.”
+
+TECH + IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
+
+Build as a single-page HTML/CSS/JavaScript app using Canvas or a simple DOM approach. No build tools required.
+
+Requirements:
+
+Runs smoothly in a browser inside an iframe/mini app.
+
+Mobile-first, but also playable on desktop.
+
+Clear code structure: separate game logic, rendering, and reward logic into readable functions.
+
+Provide:
+
+index.html, style.css, and script.js (or clearly separable sections).
+
+Comments explaining where to:
+
+Change artwork / colors / character sprite.
+
+Configure reward tiers and token price.
+
+Plug in a wallet or backend onClaimReward handler.
+
+UI & UX
+
+Start screen:
+
+Game title: The Flappy Coin.
+
+“Tap to Start” + brief instructions: “Tap / press space to flap. Avoid obstacles. Higher score = tiny token rewards.”
+
+Game screen:
+
+Top-left: current score.
+
+Top-right: best score.
+
+Game Over screen:
+
+Score, best score, and estimated reward.
+
+Two buttons: “Play Again” and “Claim via Sponsor”.
+
+Tiny disclaimer text about rewards being promotional and limited.
+
+ABUSE / ANTI-SPAM CONSIDERATIONS (FRONT-END ONLY)
+
+Add basic protections that I can later extend:
+
+Limit displayed reward to a maximum per run and optionally a maximum per session (configurable).
+
+Include a simple session ID or timestamp value that can be sent to my backend when claiming.
+
+Do not implement complex security; just structure the code clearly so I can plug in rate limits or per-wallet caps later.
+
+DELIVERABLE
+
+Generate the complete minimal code for this game:
+
+A working prototype I can drop into a mini-app environment.
+
+Easy to customize: colors, character sprite, token symbol, and reward tiers.
+
+After generating the code, briefly summarize:
+
+How the scoring works.
+
+How the reward calculation works.
+
+Where in the code I should integrate my backend or wallet claim flow.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
